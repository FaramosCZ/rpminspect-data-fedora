rpminspect-data-fedora
======================

This package provides data files used by the rpminspect program on Fedora
Linux.  Defaults are provided by the software, but the idea is that you will
customize these files based on the products you are making.  This package
overrides the template package (rpminspect-data-generic) provided by the
rpminspect package.


PACKAGING
---------

The rpminspect package builds the software and a data package called
rpminspect-data-generic.  This is a template package and is there so that
the output of the rpminspect.spec file is complete.  The generic package
does not contain anything useful.  The intent is for the vendor to create
their own data package to use in place of the generic package.

The preferred way to do that is to create an rpminspect-data-VENDOR package
and set two things in the spec file:

    Provides: rpminspect-data
    Obsoletes: rpminspect-data-generic

rpminspect in turn Requires 'rpminspect-data'.  The generic package provides
this virtual dependency as well.  The vendor package should obsolete the
generic package so we don't end up with both on the system.  But having any
single one on the system would meet the requirement of 'rpminspect-data'.
