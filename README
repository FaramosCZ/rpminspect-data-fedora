rpminspect-data-fedora
======================

This package provides data files used by the rpminspect program on
Fedora Linux.  Some defaults are provided by the software, but the
idea is that you will customize these files based on the products you
are making.


PACKAGING
---------

The rpminspect package builds the software and a data package called
rpminspect-data-generic.  This is a template package and is there so
that the output of the rpminspect.spec file is complete.  The generic
package does not contain anything vendor-specific.  The intent is for
the vendor to create their own data package to use in place of the
generic package.

The preferred way to do that is to create an rpminspect-data-VENDOR
package and add this to the spec file:

    Requires: rpminspect

rpminspect does not technically need an rpminspect-data-* package to
run.  They are just a convenient way to centralize vendor-specific
data used by rpminspect.  Care should be taken creating
vendor-specific data packages so they do not collide with other data
packages users may want installed.
